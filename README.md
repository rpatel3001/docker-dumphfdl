Docker container for running [dumphfdl](https://github.com/szpajder/dumphfdl) and forwarding the received JSON messages to another system or docker container. Best used alongside [ACARS Hub](https://github.com/fredclausen/acarshub).

Builds and runs on `amd64`, `arm64`, `arm/v7`, `arm/v6` and `386` architectures.

## Note for Users running 32-bit Debian Buster-based OSes on ARM

Please see: [Buster-Docker-Fixes](https://github.com/fredclausen/Buster-Docker-Fixes)!

## Required hardware

A computer host on a suitable architecture and one USB RTL-SDR dongle connected to an antenna.

## ACARS Hub integration

The default `SERVER` and `SERVER_PORT` values are suitable for automatically working with ACARS Hub, provided ACARS Hub is **on the same pi as the decoder**. If ACARS Hub is not on the same Pi, please provide the correct host name in the `SERVER` variable. Very likely you will not have to change the `SERVER_PORT`, but if you did change the port mapping on your ACARS Hub (and you will know if you did) please set the server port correctly as well.

## Configuration options

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `TZ` | Your timezone | No | UTC |
| `SERIAL` | The serial number of your RTL-SDR dongle | Yes | Blank |
| `FEED_ID` | Used by the decoder to insert a unique ID in to the output message | Yes | Blank |
| `FREQUENCIES` | Colon-separated list of frequencies, but to a maximum of 8, for the decoder to list to. No decimal, and all frequencies should be nine digits long. | Yes | Blank |
| `PPM` | Parts per million correction of the decoder | No | 0 |
| `GAIN`| The gain applied to the RTL-SDR dongle. | No | `40` |
| `SERVER` | The server where messages will be forwarded to. | No | Blank |
| `SERVER_PORT` | The port where the server will receive messages on. | No | `5555` |
| `VDLM_FILTER_ENABLE` | Filter out non-informational messages. Turning this off (set to a blank value) will cause increased message rate but the messages will be of little value. Will cause extra SD card read/writes. | No | `TRUE` |
| `QUIET_LOGS` | Mute log output to the bare minimum. Set to `false` to disable. | No | `TRUE` |
| `ZMQ_MODE` | Output to [zmq](https://zeromq.org) publisher socket. This sets the mode to `client` or `server`. | No | |
| `ZMQ_ENDPOINT` | Output to [zmq](https://zeromq.org) publisher socket. This sets the `endpoint`. Syntax is `tcp://address:port` | No | |
